		<h1 class="mb0">Video games! Cheer up!</h1>
		<p> I created this as a self portrait to portray my feelings of excitement and how I get cheered up by video games when I feel down. Looking forward to new video games also creates joyful anticipation within me. The Arcade machine is used to represent video games, because I began playing them on there. The character represents me, as he feels sad and lost at the beginning, but then the arcade machine appears to cheer him up. I created this scene to show how whenever I feel overwhelmed at school or other life matters, I always remember I'll have awesome video games waiting to be played as soon as I resolve them, and I also think of the future games to come. That cheers me up, and motivates me. Then, when I'm all free, I'll enjoy a nice peaceful time playing some video games (hence the silly dance at the end). Videogames were my inspiration to become an artist and I have always been mesmerized by the technology and all other resources used to create them. Without them I would have never sought to create the works I do today, nor the views I have of the future.</p>

		<h1 class="mb0">Lights of the Future</h1>
		<p> My inspiration for this project comes from a view I have of the future. I think designs projected onto buildings and other objects, or just the simple fact that you see a structure displaying different colorful designs and lights, help give a building life and makes it feel more advanced and futuristic. In the future I want to see all sorts of buildings glowing with neon lights, displaying different designs (not just advertisements). I think that would give us very futuristic and artistic environment, which is also why I use a robotic voice throughout the video; to give a feeling of what awaits us in future.</p>

       <p></p>		
		<p></p>
		<p>To create this music player I used the following libraries: p5.sceneManager to make my intro page, instruction page and the music player page. P5.sound, to load my music and play it. p5.Amplitude to get the volume of the music I’m using and make the shapes move to the volume’s rhythm. p5.FFT to create frequency waveforms that move according to the music/sound’s frequency and p5.clickable which I used to make my buttons that allow for music selection. I spent quite some time on this project, but overall I really liked the outcome.
