         <h5> Mega Red Helmet Alterations</h5>
		<p>
		This was my first exercise where the goal was to combine both sketch 1 and 2. By seeing the outcomes of both sketches (sketch 1 produced a line display and sketch 2 a bunch of random circles) I decided to try and make squares follow a line while also changing color. Thanks to the loop statemnts I was able to achieve this and it turned out ok.

    In this Exercise, we combined sketch 3 and 4. I had a bit of difficulty putting things together and figuring things out, but I eventually I produced this. The exercise is a kind of like a storm of squares with s movable image and when you press B you get a flash of light. This was achieved through the use of custom functions, move mouse commands, some if staments, and key press command.

             <h5> p5 Clock</h5>
    		<p>
    		  The overall clock was made through the use of arcs and other commands taught to us in class that keep track of time. The seconds bar is the cyan colored arc and its fill displays a different color with each passing second (achieved with colorMode). It begins small but it expands around the clock, once the arc connects, 60 seconds have gone by. The purple arc with a red fill displays minutes and the black arc with a white fill displays hours (their fill however, doesn’t change color.) During P.M hours a green turquoise color is displayed and during A.M hours a purple background is displayed. I was going to have them display different images but I had some issues with that.

          <h5> Processing Screen Saver</h5>
 		<p>
 		For this project I wanted to create something elegant and not too colorful due to everything I have made so far being like that. I used one example that was provided for us (black/white binking lines in background) I modified it and I went from there. I then added my class "Sprinkles" which are the lines going across the screen. And lastly I was having difficulty getting what I wanted in the middle but after watching a tutorial and modifying the code I ended up with what I wanted. The blinking/changing lines in the background achieve this through the use of millis, the white lines going across are repeating arrays and the circles moving at the center use sin and cos methods to achieve their movement. The algorthm being used is the NoiseWave, which kind of acts as water and the circles as a fish that jumps out from it then goes back.  <br>
