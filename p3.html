							<h2>Video games! Cheer up!</h2>
							
							
							<p style="color:white;"> I created this as a self portrait to portray my feelings of excitement and how I get cheered up by video games when I feel down. Looking forward to new video games also creates joyful anticipation within me. The Arcade machines are used to represent video games, because I began playing them on there. The character represents me, as he feels sad and lost at the beginning, but then the arcade machine appears to cheer him up. I created this scene to show how whenever I feel overwhelmed at school or other life matters, I always remember I'll have awesome video games waiting to be played as soon as I resolve them, and I also think of the future games to come. That cheers me up, and motivates me. Then, when I'm all free, I'll enjoy a nice peaceful time playing some video games (hence the silly dance at the end). Videogames were my inspiration to become a digital artist and I have always been mesmerized by the technology and all other resources used to create them. Without them I would have never sought to create the works I do today, nor the views I have of the future.</p>

								<h2>Lights of the Future</h2>
							
							
							<p style="color:white;">  My inspiration for this project comes from a view I have of the future. I think designs projected onto buildings and other objects, or just the simple fact that you see a structure displaying different colorful designs and lights, help give a building life and makes it feel more advanced and futuristic. In the future I want to see all sorts of buildings glowing with neon lights, displaying different designs (not just advertisements). I think that would give us very futuristic and artistic environment, which is also why I use a robotic voice throughout the video; to give a feeling of what awaits us in future.</p>
